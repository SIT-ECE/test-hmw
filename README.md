# Homework 2
**Deadline: 10/05/2018 5pm ET **

This assignment helps you review basic Python statements: if, for, while. 

## Instructions:

* If you are a student who is registered to this class, click on the link that I shared with you. That will create a private Github repository for you. Once you have that repository, clone it to your local by using "git clone".

* If you are not registered to this class, just clone this repository to your local.

* You are supposed to modify the file "my_answers.py" in src/mypkg. You should be able to run this file as you are editing it but tests will not be run yet.

* In order to run the tests, make sure you have pytest installed in your environment. Simply type "pip install pytest".

* In your terminal, cd to homework2-YourGithubID, type "pip install -e ." to build your program. 

* In your terminal, cd to homework2-YourGithubID and type "pytest". It should run all the tests for this assignment and you should be able to see the output.

* If you are a student registered to this class, you can commit your ONLY YOUR my_answer.py and push it your code to your private Github repository. DO NOT ADD OTHER FILES generated by pycharm or your build. Travis-CI will run the tests you ran in your local in the cloud.

* As an engineer, you are responsible for an end-to-end process of submission of your code. Failures in Travis-CI will affect your grade even if all the tests pass in your local.
